# Testing unreleased Native SDKs

> ⚠️ **CAUTION:** We should never have unreleased SDKs in the main branch. This is only for testing unreleased SDKs. All PRs to main branch should be released SDKs.

## Android
* Uncomment  `maven { url "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/" }` in `android/build.gradle`
* Specify snapshot version in `android/build.gradle` file: which must have been prebuilt from any of the PRs in the [Android](https://github.com/smileidentity/android) repo

## iOS
* Comment out the version for the native SmileID dependency in the podspec file in `./ios/smile-id.podspec` file:
```ruby
#  s.dependency "SmileID" # => Mind the version removal
```
* Specify the repo SmileID [iOS](https://github.com/smileidentity/ios) repo and pick a tag or branch podspec file in the Podfile example/ios/Podfile file:
```ruby
  pod 'SmileID', git: 'https://github.com/smileidentity/ios.git', branch: 'main'
```
* Run `pod install` in the `example/ios` folder
* If you have pod install issues run
```bash
  pod deintegrate && pod install
```

Happy testing!
