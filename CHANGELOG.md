directly by the updated SDK.

### Changed

* Update Ktlint setup and Gradle version

### Fixed  
* Refactored iOS platform view implementations to use consistent `embedView` pattern with standardized
 view controller lifecycle management for `SmileIDSmartSelfieCaptureView` and `SmileIDDocumentCaptureView`,
 fixing dark mode issues with these views.

## 11.0.2 - June 16, 2025

### Changed
* Renamed **example** folder to **sample** and replaced all usages of example in the project.
* Migrate all gradle files in the sample and SDK folders from Groovy to Kotlin.
* Add a `libs.versions.toml` file to share dependencies between the sample project and the Android SDK.
* Cleanup and minor code improvements on the gradlew files.
* Update Android Gradle Plugin and Kotlin version to the latest.
* Fail the `assemble` gradle task when `smile_config.json` file is not added in the assets folder.
* Wrapped the Android platform view implementation in a `SafeArea` widget to ensure proper handling of 
 system UI boundaries including status bars, navigation bars, and notches. This change only affects 
 the Android platform implementation while maintaining existing gesture recognition and view creation 
 behavior, ensuring the platform view content is not obscured by system UI elements.
